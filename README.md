### The Feature-Rich Ultra Factions plugin for your Minecraft: Pocket Edition PHP7 Server!
#### Create your Faction, Claim your Land, Fight your Enemies!

**This is being MAINTAINED for Versai.pro**
## Features
- [x] 3D chunk claiming system with configurable claim sizes
- [x] Faction homes, protections, and money.
- [x] Faction, Ally, Enemy, Global, Local, and even custom chat channels (for the more advanced factions, with complicated relations).
- [x] On-the-fly loading of config and data files - no reloading required! 
- [x] A very complex (but simple to use!) access system that allows for both global permission changes and per chunk access settings. 
- [x] Warzone, safezone, and peaceful faction toggles - for example, you can have multiple warzone factions, each with their own names.
- [x] Custom language/messages support. Server admins can translate the plugins themselves, or just replace the messages with their own.
- [x] Open your faction, allow others to join without invitations!

### Unique but *simple* API


#### Checking if the player belongs to a faction
Make sure you're using: `xZeroMCPE\UltraFaction\UltraFaction`

```php

/*
* $player should be instance of a Player
* returns a bool
*/

UltraFaction::getInstance()->getFactionManager()->isInFaction($player);
```

#### Get a player faction

```php

/*
* $player should be instance of a Player
* returns a \Faction\Faction object
* You should check if they belong to a faction first!
*/

$faction = UltraFaction::getInstance()->getFactionManager()->getFaction($player);

// You can also retrieve their faction name using the following:
$factionName = $faction->getName();
```
Be sure to check [`\Faction\Faction`](https://github.com/PocketEssential/UltraFaction/blob/master/src/xZeroMCPE/UltraFaction/Faction/Faction.php) for a list of methods.

#### Not quite yet
We also have a bunch of events you can tie to.

```php
// Listen to when someone creates a faction?

public function onCreate(FactionCreateEvent $event){
  
  $player = $event->getPlayer();
  
  if($event->getFactionName() == "Zero"){
   $player->sendMessage("You can't use that faction name because you're not cool!");
  }
}
```

```php
// Maybe when something changes?

public function onCreate(FactionStatusChangeEvent $event){
  
  $player = $event->getPlayer();
  
  if($event->getStatus() === FactionStatusChangeEvent::STATUS_FACTION_OPEN){
   $player->sendMessage("Oh wow, you opened your faction :o");
  }
}
```

#### That's all you need to know for now.
We have a ton of others, we'll try to update the readme, or alternatively, create a wiki
